The goal of this project is to showcase how machine learning models can be deployed in a real-world application (web-based) to help with decision-making. By using real-world data (the mushroom dataset), the project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a machine learning model, and integrate it into a web application.

This project is ideal for:

Beginners learning machine learning and web development.

Developers interested in integrating machine learning models into production environments.

People who are curious about the safety of mushrooms in the wild.
